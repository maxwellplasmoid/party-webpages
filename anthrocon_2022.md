## Party tips

This is primarily a kinky sex party with sex equipment provided, including sex furniture, sex machines, toys, and electroplay. We welcome both experienced and new comers to the party, although we prefer that all participate in sexual activities. Since space is limited, we ask that fully-clothed spectators be mindful of the space they occupy. Bring your own drinks since we will provide little alcohol and mixers will be limited.

Since we don’t  have a dedicated bouncer, please answer the door to newcomers. Ask them for the password and their ID, show them the table for wristbands, and welcome them to the party.

## Wristband System

We use a wristband system for quickly communicating comfort of touching, sexual preferrence (understanding that genders can be fluid and nebulous), and proof of STI-test. You must message @maxwellplasmoid before the party to get wristbands for STI tests. If you are colorblind or it is too dark to see the color, just ask the other person what wristbands they're wearing. We use the following colors:
    
- ![Green](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00FF00/00FF00.png) Green: “Feel free to touch me”
- ![Yellow](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffff00/FFFF00.png) Yellow: “Ask to touch me”
- ![Red](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FF000/FF0000.png) Red: “Do not ask to touch me. I will ask if I want to be touched”
- ![Blue](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0000FF/0000FF.png) Blue: I prefer masculine-presenting partners
- ![Pink](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f542ec/f542ec.png) Pink: I prefer femine-presenting partners
- ![Purple](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8400ff/8400ff.png) Purple: I have no preference for my partner’s gender
- ![Black](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000.png) Black: I have a complete STI test from within the last 3 months, including HIV, Syphilis, and Chlamydia and Gonorrhea tests via urine and oral, anal, and vaginal swabs. Send results to @maxwellplasmoid who will read through the results and assign your color.
- ![White](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFFFFF/FFFFFF.png) White: I have an STI test but it’s old or incomplete. Ask about my STI test if you need to.


## Tips for first-timers

Best way to enjoy these things is to jump straight in. Get naked and get sexy. If you want something to happen then you need to ask for it. Sex doesn’t happen spontanously, you need to ask for it. If you’re coming to the party wanting to bottom, come ready for it and make sure to ask. If you want to try out a particular toy or kink, just ask!
